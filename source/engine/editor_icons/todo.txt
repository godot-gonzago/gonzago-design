- Add more media/resource types (like image, video, sfx, music, zip in io)?
- Add more variant types? (maybe replace with editor icons for 2D and 3D?)


- Create default theme icon set etc (base on godot default theme, but also add own variant like already started)
- Fill out meta data in all files to reference where Godot original icons were recreated
  - Meta data can be used for creating AUTHORS.md or license information
