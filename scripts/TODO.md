- File modified cache using MD5 or something of the sort.
    - We then can crawl through the filesystem and only handle sources with changes.
- Crawl through filesystem (recursion?) and keep paths.
- Some sort of build config might be necessairy to specify what needs to be done.
- Conversion from svg to png.
- Get real color info from Godot source.
- How to handle 3D assets and sound/video assets and themes and so forth?
